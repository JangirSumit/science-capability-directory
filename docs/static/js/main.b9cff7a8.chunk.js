Research into plant physiology, molecular and cell biology is providing fundamental insights into developing enhanced food production, agricultural sustainability, environmental quality and products for human health.","Centre summary":"The Centre is an internationally-renowned research network of plant scientists conducting cutting-edge research into predominantly legumes and other plant species.","Sectors":"Biotechnology; Environment and nature; Food and agriculture; Life sciences; Tropical","Fields of Research":"","Strengths and capabilities":"- Plant physiology\\n- Plant genetics\\n- Molecular and cell biology","Facilities and major equipment":"","Research staff":"20-100 research staff","Keywords":"","Organisation type":"- University Research Centre","Primary centre":"Centre for Integrative Legume Research","Latitude":-27.498813,"Longitude":153.012138,"Address":"John Hines Building (62) Level 2, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, 4072","Other Australian locations":"","Centre image":"101024-cilr.jpg","Image description":"Flowers of a Pongamia tree","Title scientist 1":"","Name scientist 1":"","Link scientist 1":"","Achievement scientist 1":"","Title scientist 2":"","Name scientist 2":"","Link scientist 2":"","Achievement scientist 2":"","Title scientist 3":"","Name scientist 3":"","Link scientist 3":"","Achievement scientist 3":"","Centre achievements":"","Year recipient 1":"","Project name recipient 1":"","Link recipient 1":"","Year recipient 2":"","Project name recipient 2":"","Link recipient 2":"","Year recipient 3":"","Project name recipient 3":"","Link recipient 3":"","Key science sectors":"- [Biotechnology](http://www.qld.gov.au/dsiti/about-us/business-areas/science-precincts-projects/biotechnology/) \\n- [Environment and nature](http://www.qld.gov.au/dsiti/about-us/business-areas/science-precincts-projects/environment-nature/)\\n- [Food and agriculture](http://www.qld.gov.au/dsiti/about-us/business-areas/science-precincts-projects/food-agriculture/)\\n- [Life sciences] (http://www.qld.gov.au/dsiti/about-us/business-areas/science-precincts-projects/life-sciences/)\\n- [Tropical](http://www.qld.gov.au/dsiti/about-us/business-areas/science-precincts-projects/tropical/)","logo":"//uq.edu.au/templates/web/images/logo-ua.png","logo_clean":"http://www.cilr.uq.edu.au//uq.edu.au/templates/web/images/logo-ua.png","logo_clean__1":"http://www.cilr.uq.edu.au//uq.edu.au/templates/web/images/logo-ua.png"},{"Centre name":"Centre for Macroalgal Resources & Biotechnology","Abbreviation":"MACRO","Former centre name":"","Parent organisation":"James Cook University","Weblink":"https://research.jcu.edu.au/macro","Overview":"The Centre\'s research includes the assessment of valuable bioproducts and biotechnology based on the unique biochemistry and properties of algae and the co-location of algal production with existing industries for bioremediation (treating\xa0 waste streams).

The JKMRC has worked in close partnership with global mining companies for almost 50 years and has developed a strong reputation for delivering innovative research outcomes.    The JKMRC is the largest Australian research centre in its field and collaborates with major mining and mineral processing research groups worldwide.  The research activities are sponsored by most of the major mining companies around the world as well as equipment and technology providers.    JKMRC produces world-class research outcomes applicable to a range of commodities.  The key research goals are to maximise resource utilisation and to minimise energy and water use.    Research and postgraduate training programs deal with challenges in exploration, geometallurgy, comminution, separation and flotation.
